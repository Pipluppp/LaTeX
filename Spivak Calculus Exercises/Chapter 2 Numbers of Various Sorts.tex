\subsection{Number of Various Sorts}
\begin{defi}[Mathematical Induction] Suppose that $P(x)$ means that the property
$P$ holds for the number $x$. Then the principle of mathematical induction
states that $P(x)$ holds for all natural numbers $x$ provided that
\begin{itemize}
    \item $P(1)$ is true.
    \item Whenever $P(k)$ is true, $P(k+1)$ is true.
\end{itemize}     
\end{defi}

(Note: In the construction of the natural numbers from the \emph{Peano Axioms},
induction is an axiom and $0$ is an element of the naturals.)
